I am a MSc graduate student at University of Toronto, part of the [embARC](https://nandita-research-website-tan.vercel.app/) research group, on a part-time basis, under the supervision of Professor [Nandita Vijaykumar](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~nandita/). I am a Vector Institute affiliate researcher and I am also affiliated with the Robotics Institute at University of Toronto.

I am a staff computer vision engineer at TORC Robotics, on a full-time basis.

My research interests are in computer vision and physics-based simulations, and robotics.
